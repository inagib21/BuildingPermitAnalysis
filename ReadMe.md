# Project Overview
Our project has two primary goals: identify and predict trends in NYC building permits and classify pre-1940 buildings based on recent maintenance. These efforts provide critical insights for our investment firm stakeholders, helping them seize valuable real estate opportunities.

# Business Understanding:
Real estate, a key economic driver in NYC, continually evolves due to the constant demand for new construction. By understanding these trends, stakeholders, like investment firms, make informed decisions and capitalize on lucrative opportunities. 

## Stakeholder: MetroStar Real Estate Investment Firm

MetroStar Real Estate Investment Firm is a NYC-based entity keen on leveraging data to understand and predict city construction trends. By focusing on new developments and buildings ripe for renovation, the firm aims to capitalize on investment potential. Our data analysis and predictive modeling services will offer crucial insights, shaping their future investment strategies effectively.

# Data Understanding: 
We used two datasets, [DOB NOW: Build â€“ Approved Permits](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-NOW-Build-Approved-Permits/rbx6-tga4) and [PLUTO](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page), which offer comprehensive information on building permits and extensive land use details respectively.

## Old Buildings Classification & Maintenance 
We identified pre-1940 NYC buildings and categorized them based on maintenance status post-2018: 
- **Maintained Buildings:** Received upkeep since 2018, potentially in better condition but could still benefit from improvements.
- **Unmaintained Buildings:** Lacked maintenance since 2018, offering significant renovation and value enhancement opportunities.

Classification Model Insights
The 'Approved Year' feature played a critical role in our model due to its strong connection with recent renovation activity. This aligns with our goal of identifying older buildings in top community boards that haven't seen recent upgrades, enabling targeted renovation planning and effective resource allocation.

However, the tight correlation between 'Approved Year' and the target variable 'recent_permit' might lead some to view this as data leakage. Hence, while the model successfully predicts recent renovations, its predictions may not go beyond what can be directly inferred from the 'Approved Year'.

In attempt to adress the data leakage and improve our model's performance, we identified and removed features potentially causing data leakage, specifically "Approved Date", "Approved Year", and "Approved Month". Despite removing these features, our model achieved a remarkable 99% accuracy. The "C B NO" feature was retained, given its significance in prediction. Our efforts confirm that our model can deliver reliable predictions even with these changes, demonstrating its robustness.




# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
We cleaned and preprocessed the datasets by handling missing values, converting data types, and extracting useful features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We conducted an EDA to understand data trends, distributions, and relationships, and identified top community boards within each borough based on building permit growth.

Here we can see the distribution of permits approved by borough:

# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting: 
We performed time series analysis on the permit data and utilized several models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to forecast permit approval trends over the next year for each top community board.

### Prediction results for community board with the most growth in the BRONX.

- RMSE: 13.68
  - MAE: 10.31

Our LSTM model's performance in predicting the number of building permits for the top community board in the Bronx is promising. The model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 13.68 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10.31. These metrics suggest that our forecasts are close to the actual values, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting building permit trends for future strategic planning.

# Prediction Results

Our LSTM model for predicting community board growth across the boroughs provided the following results:

- **Bronx (CB 204.0)**:
  - RMSE: 13.68
  - MAE: 10.31

- **Brooklyn (CB 301.0)**:
  - RMSE: 33.68
  - MAE: 28.21

- **Manhattan (CB 105.0)**:
  - RMSE: 37.96
  - MAE: 30.17

- **Queens (CB 407.0)**:
  - RMSE: 24.04
  - MAE: 18.08

- **Staten Island (CB 501.0)**:
  - RMSE: 21.03
  - MAE: 18.33

The average RMSE across all boroughs for the LSTM model was 26.08. These results show the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) for each borough's predicted growth. These metrics provide a measure of how well our model fits the observed data - lower values indicate better fit. Remember, these results are meant to serve as a guide and additional comprehensive analysis should always be conducted.
